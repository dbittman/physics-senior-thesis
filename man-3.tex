\textbf{DESCRIPTION}\\
\> This library provides fast solving of a 2-D discrete boundary value problem using the\\
	\> Poisson equation. The full process is to define a \texttt{struct grid}, and set its \texttt{len} field.\\
	\> Then call \texttt{init\_grid} on the grid to initialize the 2-D contiguous arrays. After that,\\
	\> call \texttt{solve} and pass it the grid and a method, either \texttt{SOLVE\_METHOD\_JACOBI} or\\
	\> \texttt{SOLVE\_METHOD\_SOR}.\\
	\\
	\> The \texttt{solve} function will return when complete, returning back a value describing how\\
	\> confident it is in its result (values closer to zero are better). The \texttt{iters} field in the grid\\
	\> will have been updated to indicate how many iterations the program took. The \texttt{values}\\
	\> field points to a 2-D array of size \texttt{len} by \texttt{len} containing the solution.\\
