\section{Program Usage}

Compiling the engine (the C library) requires make and gcc (or clang, though clang is untested), and can
be done by simply invoking \texttt{make}. This will also create an executable file, \texttt{solve}. This
is a script that invokes the python example frontend so that it may be used.

For more details on using the python frontend or the C backend engine, see the man pages (reproduced on the
following pages). There are several example files, including \texttt{example\_sin.txt} and \texttt{example\_dipole.txt}.
For more details on writing configurations for a desired simulation or experiment, see the man pages.

The source code also contains a directory named \texttt{tests}, which contains python code to generate verifier data
files for the \texttt{example\_sin} configuration. Finally, all of the data written on in this document are present
in the source directory, under \texttt{results}. The source code for the C library is in \texttt{engine}, and the
source code for the python example frontend is under \texttt{frontend}. The source code and git revision history
is available at \url{http://github.com/dbittman/statics-solver}.
