\section*{Abstract}

\onehalfspacing

There are many problems in physics which involve solving a set of equations which define behavior
inside some region. One such set of problems, among many, is solving electrostatics problems inside
a region given some boundary conditions by utilizing Poisson's equation. Such problems, and other
problems, are commonly found in simple and analytically solvable forms in undergraduate physics classes.
Unfortunately, these problems can become intractible to solve analytically very quickly as their complexity
increases. Complex boundary conditions in stangely shaped regions can easy become impossibly difficult to
solve. The solution to this problem can be to model it on a computer in order to compute a numerical solution
in place of an analytical one.

I have written a software package which is both a C library which can solve such a given problem and a frontend
Python program which can parse a human-readable configuation that describes such a boundary value problem and
set up the correct initial state such that the C library can then solve it, allowing the Python program to
display the final result as well as calculate statistics about the solving process. I have utilized effective
programming techniques designed for current generation hardware 64-bit x86 processors in order to improve
the performance of the program, in addition to implementing a multi-threaded version of the solving program
to explore the use of multicore processors in solving these problems.

I found that the program correctly matched an analytical soltuion to a simple test problem, and that it correctly
predicted the $1/r^2$ potential found from an electric dipole. I was able to optimize the program so that it
efficiently found these results, and I was able to successfully leverage multithreading to significantly increase
the performance, albiet with a degredation in simulation accuracy.

\section{Program Usage}

Compiling the engine (the C library) requires make and gcc (or clang, although clang is untested), and can
be done by simply invoking \texttt{make}. This will also create an executable file, \texttt{solve}. This
is a script that invokes the python example frontend so that it may be used.

For more details on using the python frontend or the C backend engine, see the man pages (reproduced on the
following pages). There are several example files, including \texttt{example\_sin.txt} and \texttt{example\_dipole.txt}.
For more details on writing configurations for a desired simulation or experiment, see the man pages.

The source code also contains a directory named \texttt{tests}, which contains python code to generate verifier data
files for the \texttt{example\_sin} configuration. Finally, all of the data written on in this document are present
in the source directory, under \texttt{results}. The source code for the C library is in \texttt{engine}, and the
source code for the python example frontend is under \texttt{frontend}. The source code and git revision history
is available at \url{http://github.com/dbittman/statics-solver}.
